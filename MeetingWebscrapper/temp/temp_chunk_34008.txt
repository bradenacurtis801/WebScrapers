they are
Prasad Reddy: statically by the router.
Prasad Reddy: or by dynamically
Prasad Reddy: by the same router
Prasad Reddy: or a DSE impact insert.
Prasad Reddy: We should
Prasad Reddy: by the
Prasad Reddy: Their assigned when they are assigned
Prasad Reddy: assigned what it means is that.
Prasad Reddy: in Mac address is
Prasad Reddy: attached to
Prasad Reddy: is a table that is maintained by
Prasad Reddy: DHCP server.
Prasad Reddy: That is how it is done.
Prasad Reddy: in
Prasad Reddy: There is something called.
Prasad Reddy: In the past
Prasad Reddy: protocol
Prasad Reddy: That's a
Prasad Reddy: one is
Prasad Reddy: in the OSI layers you
Prasad Reddy: seven layers
Prasad Reddy: It's basically networking,
Prasad Reddy: increasing complexity.
Prasad Reddy: anything at the bottom of
Prasad Reddy: layer?
Prasad Reddy: is
Prasad Reddy: The first layer is considered as a
Prasad Reddy: physical layer.
Prasad Reddy: that means
Prasad Reddy: physical devices considered as
Prasad Reddy: layer one.
Prasad Reddy: and then
Prasad Reddy: the second layer is your Mac ID
Prasad Reddy: Third layer is a
Prasad Reddy: IP addresses
Prasad Reddy: when a
Prasad Reddy: each other
Prasad Reddy: switch.
Prasad Reddy: When they are connected to each other
Prasad Reddy: the switch the switch will
Prasad Reddy: certain amount of data.
Prasad Reddy: if it only maintains the Mac IDs
Prasad Reddy: is called a layer 2 switch.
Prasad Reddy: whereas
Prasad Reddy: if the switch maintains the
Prasad Reddy: information
Prasad Reddy: Mac IDs as well as their
Prasad Reddy: addresses.
Prasad Reddy: That is
Prasad Reddy: and layer 3 switch
Prasad Reddy: These are also called
Prasad Reddy: switches.
Prasad Reddy: coming to
Prasad Reddy: anytime that you basically
Prasad Reddy: the computer typically
Prasad Reddy: specify
Prasad Reddy: Three or four things.
Prasad Reddy: Those are
Prasad Reddy: IP address
Prasad Reddy: and then
Prasad Reddy: Actually, it's already
Prasad Reddy: IP address
Prasad Reddy: Gateway
Prasad Reddy: and then broadcast
Prasad Reddy: so these are the four things that
Prasad Reddy: mentioned.
Prasad Reddy: So what
Prasad Reddy: suppose if they have enough
Prasad Reddy: address
Prasad Reddy: I'll give an example in for these
Prasad Reddy: four
Prasad Reddy: 192.168 Dark One Dark One.
Prasad Reddy: Subnet is
Prasad Reddy: Gateway is
Prasad Reddy: 2.168
Prasad Reddy: Let's say one.
Prasad Reddy: Well actually.
Prasad Reddy: if I
Prasad Reddy: And broadcast it is.
Prasad Reddy: 192.1
Prasad Reddy: 68
Prasad Reddy: one dot
Prasad Reddy: 355
Prasad Reddy: this is a sample that I sent.
Prasad Reddy: so the
Prasad Reddy: up a machine.
Prasad Reddy: You set up something like this.
Prasad Reddy: if you set up
Prasad Reddy: IP whereas
Prasad Reddy: 
Prasad Reddy: It is received by a DHCP
Prasad Reddy: it is a dynamic IP.
Prasad Reddy: Whichever way you set up
Prasad Reddy: static or dynamic.
Prasad Reddy: These are the
Prasad Reddy: there.
Prasad Reddy: So first one is
Prasad Reddy: just like a person has a name.
Prasad Reddy: This is more like
Prasad Reddy: the number for the computer
Prasad Reddy: attached to the math ID.
Prasad Reddy: And what about this subnet?
Prasad Reddy: subnet is which
Prasad Reddy: where does this
Prasad Reddy: Sai
Prasad Reddy: that
Prasad Reddy: where
Prasad Reddy: is.
Prasad Reddy: Which
Prasad Reddy: to?
Prasad Reddy: This is a
Prasad Reddy: writing here.
Prasad Reddy: 255 means
Prasad Reddy: is
Prasad Reddy: when
Prasad Reddy: ins
