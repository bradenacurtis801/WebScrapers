you get
Prasad Reddy: an idea.
Prasad Reddy: so
Prasad Reddy: what stable diffusion does?
Prasad Reddy: Is you give a text?
Prasad Reddy: I want
Prasad Reddy: the
Prasad Reddy: And it will generate.
Prasad Reddy: There are other
Prasad Reddy: diffusion is there and
Prasad Reddy: diffusion is
Prasad Reddy: mid journey is
Prasad Reddy: closed.
Prasad Reddy: obviously
Prasad Reddy: diffusion.
Prasad Reddy: Mid Journey will be a lot more
Prasad Reddy: sharper Mark lot more,
Prasad Reddy: a better picture.
Prasad Reddy: better picture.
Prasad Reddy: Let's put it.
Prasad Reddy: Automatic 1111 gives
Prasad Reddy: wrap around top of stable
Prasad Reddy: as well as it gives you a little bit
Prasad Reddy: of tools if I remember but I'm not
Prasad Reddy: 100% sure.
Prasad Reddy: Now, I'll stop the deform.
Prasad Reddy: Let's talk about
Prasad Reddy: What run diffusion does is.
Prasad Reddy: suppose you have
Prasad Reddy: stable diffusion
Prasad Reddy: that you want to delete
Prasad Reddy: want to add something without
Prasad Reddy: You saw Runway ml how it did.
Prasad Reddy: You edit a certain area you
Prasad Reddy: change it and it is creating.
Prasad Reddy: area.
Prasad Reddy: It is creating
Prasad Reddy: Whereas a run
Prasad Reddy: is
Prasad Reddy: You basically put like, you know.
Prasad Reddy: a sales ships or like no
Prasad Reddy: the ocean?
Prasad Reddy: We have a picture with ocean,
Prasad Reddy: know like a beach and then
Prasad Reddy: you basically
Prasad Reddy: select a small area
Prasad Reddy: that you want a warship there
Prasad Reddy: old
Prasad Reddy: with the sales same
Prasad Reddy: It will basically put in that area
Prasad Reddy: you highlight.
Prasad Reddy: I want a sales ship here.
Prasad Reddy: It will put that same shape.
Prasad Reddy: That is run diffusion.
Prasad Reddy: Run diffusion is a
Prasad Reddy: And what does a
Prasad Reddy: I'm creates?
Prasad Reddy: a deformed creates
Prasad Reddy: How does it do you
Prasad Reddy: fastest screen?
Prasad Reddy: 10th Frame or the 200 frame?
Prasad Reddy: In a video
Prasad Reddy: up in between that is what
Prasad Reddy: does.
Prasad Reddy: What does
Prasad Reddy: It is similar to run diffusion.
Prasad Reddy: where
Prasad Reddy: Instead of just adding a
Prasad Reddy: it is basically when you
Prasad Reddy: certain area so
Prasad Reddy: ideal
Prasad Reddy: Are creating better images
Prasad Reddy: the images?
Prasad Reddy: whereas a Runway ml
Prasad Reddy: adding movement
Prasad Reddy: motion to those
Prasad Reddy: the
Prasad Reddy: Before them
Prasad Reddy: diffusion and automatic 1111 is also
Prasad Reddy: open source.
Prasad Reddy: And it deform has been a very
Prasad Reddy: in the Discord community.
Prasad Reddy: and they wanted
Prasad Reddy: partner because they want to try
Prasad Reddy: then later they will charge.
Prasad Reddy: And I said that for sure for a couple
Prasad Reddy: of months.
Prasad Reddy: I'm going to provide this free of
Prasad Reddy: cost if you want
Prasad Reddy: and they created a group
Prasad Reddy: discuss.
Prasad Reddy: so
Prasad Reddy: by a group of Engineers.
Prasad Reddy: Who do this as a passion
Prasad Reddy: And for example, the leader his name
Prasad Reddy: is Scott.
Prasad Reddy: God works as
Prasad Reddy: government.
Prasad Reddy: so
Prasad Reddy: chemistry Group, which is
Prasad Reddy: like that here somebody dropped here
Prasad Reddy: or what?
Prasad Reddy: And sidharthan I want them
Prasad Reddy: into research about.
Prasad Reddy: biomedical related
