: testing as to how how the software
Prasad Reddy: works.
Prasad Reddy: That's all.
Prasad Reddy: It's an interesting part
Prasad Reddy: Okay,
Prasad Reddy: Okay.
Prasad Reddy: Coming to networking.
Prasad Reddy: Hey Braden.
Prasad Reddy: Did you get any response from
Prasad Reddy: yashwant?
Braden Curtis: Yeah, he said he would he won't be
Braden Curtis: able to make it tonight.
Prasad Reddy: Okay fair enough.
Prasad Reddy: So on the
Prasad Reddy: the networking there's a
Prasad Reddy: computers when they talk to each
Prasad Reddy: other
Prasad Reddy: they need to have a name and a
Prasad Reddy: some kind of a mechanism.
Prasad Reddy: Just like the I'm talking here
Prasad Reddy: or Sai Rakesh.
Prasad Reddy: So these network interface
Prasad Reddy: a number?
Prasad Reddy: or an ID
Prasad Reddy: that is called a matte ID.
Prasad Reddy: Mac ID is
Prasad Reddy: Once it is
Prasad Reddy: changed.
Prasad Reddy: Mac ID
Prasad Reddy: six
Prasad Reddy: One byte is 8 Bits.
Prasad Reddy: So it's a
Prasad Reddy: It's basically
Prasad Reddy: the power of
Prasad Reddy: That means there are.
Prasad Reddy: combinations in a
Prasad Reddy: Mac addresses are
Prasad Reddy: of data.
Prasad Reddy: out of those six bytes
Prasad Reddy: the first to three bytes
Prasad Reddy: company
Prasad Reddy: meaning the
Prasad Reddy: is manufacturing
Prasad Reddy: interface card make
Prasad Reddy: It could be Dell it could be
Prasad Reddy: It could be your background.
Prasad Reddy: It could be compact computer
Prasad Reddy: could be Cisco switch because
Prasad Reddy: switches have
Prasad Reddy: mix
Prasad Reddy: computers have Nicks
Prasad Reddy: similarly
Prasad Reddy: wireless devices
Prasad Reddy: because they have to
Prasad Reddy: other.
Prasad Reddy: and the cell
Prasad Reddy: SIM cards.
Prasad Reddy: so
Prasad Reddy: others will have a Mac ID.
Prasad Reddy: And that is
Prasad Reddy: data.
Prasad Reddy: the first three bytes
Prasad Reddy: is going to be
Prasad Reddy: manufacturer's ID
Prasad Reddy: and that is maintained by
Prasad Reddy: iteratively.
Prasad Reddy: some
Prasad Reddy: issue.
Prasad Reddy: Who can use
Prasad Reddy: first
Prasad Reddy: manufacture, you know that's called I
Prasad Reddy: think organization ideas
Prasad Reddy: something.
Prasad Reddy: The remaining
Prasad Reddy: device ID
Prasad Reddy: so this is when
Prasad Reddy: manufacturing it is permanently
Prasad Reddy: burned it's etched.
Prasad Reddy: it is permanently burned into
Prasad Reddy: Network interface card, you cannot
Prasad Reddy: change it.
Prasad Reddy: the computers
Prasad Reddy: Can I talk to each other
Prasad Reddy: math IDs?
Prasad Reddy: now
Prasad Reddy: What about the eyepiece?
Prasad Reddy: IP addresses
Prasad Reddy: the IP addresses
Prasad Reddy: or built
Prasad Reddy: these are temporary numbers.
Prasad Reddy: These are built on
Prasad Reddy: They are associated with
Prasad Reddy: IP
Prasad Reddy: are represented by
Prasad Reddy: each byte we talked about
Prasad Reddy: these 256 combinations
Prasad Reddy: 256.
Prasad Reddy: If it is 2 bytes of data.
Prasad Reddy: You will have
Prasad Reddy: because it is
Prasad Reddy: If you have
Prasad Reddy: That would be 16 million.
Prasad Reddy: If you have 4 bytes
Prasad Reddy: That would be
Prasad Reddy: So
Prasad Reddy: or basically conscious, you
Prasad Reddy: arranged.
Prasad Reddy: The total number are 4 bytes.
Prasad Reddy: That means the total is about
Prasad Reddy: billion.
Prasad Reddy: So
Prasad Reddy: computers
Prasad Reddy:
