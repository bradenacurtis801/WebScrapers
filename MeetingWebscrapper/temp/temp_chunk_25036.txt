Prasad Reddy: an with
Sidharthan S C be21b039: You can
Prasad Reddy: So
Prasad Reddy: Two links read about
Prasad Reddy: What is
Prasad Reddy: you know like our document mechanisms
Prasad Reddy: and you don't have to go through
Prasad Reddy: 
Prasad Reddy: What is what
Prasad Reddy: this table
Prasad Reddy: Google
Prasad Reddy: Read
Prasad Reddy: What is MD?
Prasad Reddy: What is MC?
Prasad Reddy: What is
Prasad Reddy: What is qm?
Prasad Reddy: What is GP what is comments license
Prasad Reddy: things like that?
Prasad Reddy: basics?
Prasad Reddy: Once you be read about it the
Prasad Reddy: articles that I sent and a little bit
Prasad Reddy: related to that spend some time
Prasad Reddy: research.
Prasad Reddy: You will understand
Prasad Reddy: feel and then
Prasad Reddy: days
Prasad Reddy: docker
Prasad Reddy: You can
Prasad Reddy: we should be
Prasad Reddy: I don't impose
Prasad Reddy: It's all about
Prasad Reddy: the devops and
Prasad Reddy: and there are a lot of things
Prasad Reddy: to protein folding.
Prasad Reddy: That is all AI based.
Prasad Reddy: so
Prasad Reddy: this is something that I want
Prasad Reddy: guys to look into.
Prasad Reddy: and part
Prasad Reddy: and let me see.
Prasad Reddy: Who else.
Prasad Reddy: Sai Rakesh
bharath srinivas5: Yeah.
Prasad Reddy: You know what?
Prasad Reddy: I'm good,
Prasad Reddy: in
Prasad Reddy: there is
Prasad Reddy: software
Prasad Reddy: building software
Prasad Reddy: We are thinking about integrating.
Prasad Reddy: We basically got
Prasad Reddy: company called
Prasad Reddy: They wanted to work with
Prasad Reddy: an open
Prasad Reddy: and they built a product
Prasad Reddy: wanted if we can provide
Prasad Reddy: Computing through the
Prasad Reddy: For being able to do that.
Prasad Reddy: We have a computer resources very
Prasad Reddy: easy on
Prasad Reddy: should know as
Prasad Reddy: using and all that so that if they
Prasad Reddy: want to charge later, this is a
Prasad Reddy: building module these two are open.
